# Intro to PDB (skip section 1)

Download a `.csv` file from the PDB website to answer a few questions. 
```{r}
pdbfile <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1, )
xray <- pdbfile$Xray
xray <- as.integer(xray, gsub(",","", xray))
xray
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}

```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

# Section 2: Visualising HIV-1 Protease structure

We can use Mol* to visualize the HIV-1 3D structure properly.

# Introduction to Bio3D in R

The `Bio3D` package for structural bioinformatics enables us to read and work with biomolecules, on a more structural level. 


```{r}
library(bio3d)
#calling the packages
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

There are 198 amino acids in this protein.
The non-nucleic compounds are: water and the Merck-1 compound. 
There are 2 protein chains in this structure. 

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Looking at another structure adenyl kinase
```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```
There are 214 amino acids in this. 

These are proteins "stuck" in time. It would be helpful to understand the flexibility of these proteins. 

## Normal Mode Analysis
This is a bioinformatics tool for predicting functional motions. It helps in understanding the flexibility of proteins. We can use the function `nma()` to do this. 

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```
